# Demo Script (Feature Done Presentation)

This is a short, repeatable demo flow you can use to present the project to a client.

Target length: **8–12 minutes**.

Works best with:

- Single-port mode: http://localhost:5000 (recommended for demo)

---

## 0) Demo setup (before the meeting)

- Ensure DB is migrated + seeded.
- Ensure assets are real (no placeholders visible).
- Ensure Contact page has a real Google Maps embed URL.
- Ensure SMTP is configured (optional to show live email, but mandatory for Feature Done proof).

Open these tabs in advance:

1. Home
2. Products
3. A product details page
4. Quote page
5. Admin login
6. Admin quotes list

---

## 1) 30-second pitch

- “This is a B2B lead-generation platform (not e-commerce).”
- “Customers browse products and request quotes.”
- “Admins manage products/brands/categories and handle quote requests.”

---

## 2) Public browsing (2–3 minutes)

### Home

- Show trust indicators and core sections.
- Mention: no heavy animations, industrial clean UI.

### Products

- Apply category filter
- Apply brand filter (show multi-brand support if available)
- Search by keyword
- Confirm: **no pricing** anywhere

### Product details

- Open a product
- Show specs
- Show datasheet download (if available)

---

## 3) Quote request (2 minutes)

- Go to Quote page
- Submit a quote request with realistic details
- Show success confirmation

---

## 4) Admin workflow (3–4 minutes)

### Admin login

- Login

### Quotes

- Open Quotes list
- Show the newly submitted quote
- Update status (pending → processing → completed)

### Products / Categories / Brands

- Show one example of CRUD (create or edit)

### Audit logs (if enabled)

- Show that admin actions are logged

---

## 5) Optional: Email proof (1 minute)

If SMTP is configured:

- Submit another quote quickly
- Show admin email received (subject + timestamp)

---

## 6) Wrap up (30 seconds)

- “This meets Phase 1 scope: catalog + quote pipeline + admin.”
- “Ready for handover once final content/assets and production deployment checklist are completed.”
